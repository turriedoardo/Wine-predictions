# Wine Quality Prediction
For this analysis, I used a Scikit learn dataset containing the characteristics of many wines.  
The information for each wine covered a wide range of features, such as the chemical composition, the alcohol percentage, the acidity, and many more.  
First, I conducted an EDA to understand the data and visualize it, and then use it to feed some ML models. The target of the study was the wine quality of each example in the data.  
During the training of the algorithms, I performed some hyperparameters tuning for each of them, and after getting the first results, I accomplished some feature selection.  
Finally, I re-evaluated the results of Random Forest to determine if the features removed caused a huge loss in terms of performance.
